Iron Hit Counter
===================

I was getting really confused about how to have Rust's Iron maintain state on the server between requests. I ended up playing around with Handler types since that would allow me to encapsulate my web app's datatypes into different structs and keep my project cleaner. 

Hopefully you can use this to figure out some things about Iron. It's a great framework.
